Project outline
===============
Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over 
time after surgery.

Jane is a Data Scientist.
Samit is a Statistician.

We will need to determine who is responsible for what in this project.

It's likely we will need a research software engineer with Python or R 
programming skills. They will need to be familiar with matplotlib and 
ggplot.

Version control skills would also be useful, as would the ability to use 
GitHub.
